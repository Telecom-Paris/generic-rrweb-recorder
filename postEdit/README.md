## How to control it ?

With key bindings: 
 - 'd' -> set a selection
 - 'r' -> remove selection
 - 'm' -> merge all selections if they are next to each other
 - 's' -> split selection at the cursor position
 - '->' -> move cursor to right
 - '<-' -> move cursor to left

Using mouse:
 - Long click and drag mouse -> move cursor
 - Long click and drag + shift -> set a selection area (you have to approve it with 'd')
 - Long click and drag over a existing selection -> move the selection
 - Long click and drag on the border of a selection -> change the size of the selection

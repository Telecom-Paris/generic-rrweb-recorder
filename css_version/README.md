# Generic-rrweb-recorder (css version)

### How to install it ?

Just include a line in the header of your website :

(or at the bottom of your body if you want your website to load faster)

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/of/js/file/recorder.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
```

The script takes care of the rest.

For the configuration, the options remain the same, you can refer to the original version [here](../README.md).

### How to install it ?

Just include a line in the header of your website :

(or at the bottom of your body if you want your website to load faster)

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="path/of/js/file/recorder.js"></script>
```

The script takes care of the rest.

### Customize it as you want:

The script has a basic configuration, but here is what you can customize:
- position (default is **"bottom-left"**)
  list of avaibalble position:
  - bottom
  - bottom-right
  - bottom-left
  - top
  - top-right
  - top-left
  - middle
  - middle-left
  - middle-right
- if the buttons are movable (default is **true**)

### More documentation

To build the documentation, you need [jsdoc](https://jsdoc.app/index.html).

Once installed, you can build the documentation using
```jsdoc *.js -d doc```

You will find it under the doc folder, in HTML format
